# Single-Player-Pong
This is my final project for my 2nd year Digital Systems course (U of T). It's a single-player version of the arcade game "Pong" implemented in Verilog. I worked with a partner to create it.

The game is not 100% complete; there are bugs affecting the logic that controls when it hits the bottom of the screen (i.e. the game never ends).

Also, we did not write the VGA encoder modules.
